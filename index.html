                    The main material I use to build with is code, but I've also be known
                    to make things out of wood, electronics, food and musical instruments too.

                            Over a 5-year tenure I've progressed from engineer to senior engineer and currently to engineering lead
                            for the company. Notable achievements include building all of our integrations (SSO, MS Teams and Slack),
                            re-designing our primary results calculation engine for a 3x user increase, co-ordinating a .NET Framework
                            to modern .NET upgrade.

                            The start of my professional career. Completed a 1-year graduate program then another year of full-time
                            employment. Developed solutions for customers in both the commercial and public sectors. Also learned
                            the ins-and-outs of how an extremely large company (100,00 staff at the time) operates.
                            <br />
                            I also started the <em>developer's guild</em> in my time there: A club for developers around the company
                            to meet once a month to share skills in the form of structured presentations back to the group.

                    I've had a very wide range of experiences around all facets of web & cloud development. I've highly proficient in .NET,
                    JavaScript/TypeScript & React, but also have experience with Python, Ruby, Java & VueJS.

                    If YAML is your thing, I'm right at home having built many pipelines for a range of purposes (builds, releases, preview-environment

                    Every part of the development process at all of my workplaces have had some part of testing built in for every
                    developer and I've been lucky enough to have a say in how most of those processes have been designed. I've had a
                    hand across the whole spectrum from manual to automated test plans and release management and love the tools I've
                    used for them (Jest, ViTest, NUnit, Cypress & Playwright to name a few).

                    It's a bit more of a niche skill but worth pointing out that I've done a lot of work with integrations over my time
                    so far and more specifically <i>Microsoft</i> integrations. This covers everything from Entra ID SSO to MS Graph APIs
                    and especially MS Teams. I've now had the pleasure of building MS Teams integrations for both DXC and Teamgage, anything
                    from simple chat bots to internal web applications and messaging extensions.

                    I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Systems) with first-class Honours in 2018 at the University of
                    Adelaide (to soon be renamed Adelaide University).
                    <br />
                    My honours thesis was on the topic of <i>The Efficacy of Evolutionary Algorithms on the Optimisation of
                    Spiking Neutral Networks for Control Applications</i>.
