                    I am someone who loves to make and learn.

                    <br />
                    The main material I use to build with is code, but I've also be known
                    to make things out of wood, electronics, food and musical instruments too.

                            Over a 5-year tenure I've progressed from engineer to senior engineer and currently to engineering lead
                            for the company. Notable achievements include building all of our integrations (SSO, MS Teams and Slack),
                            re-designing our primary results calculation engine for a 3x user increase, co-ordinating a .NET Framework
                            to modern .NET upgrade.

                            The start of my professional career. Completed a 1-year graduate program then another year of full-time
                            employment. Developed solutions for customers in both the commercial and public sectors. Also learned
                            the ins-and-outs of how an extremely large company (100,00 staff at the time) operates.
                            <br />
                            I also started the <em>developer's guild</em> in my time there: A club for developers around the company
                            to meet once a month to share skills in the form of structured presentations back to the group.
